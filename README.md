# MidnightReeds
Hello and welcome!
My name is Logan, and you have found the site I have set up to share my projects. Here I will share the podcasts, music, creative writing and sometimes just some random thoughts I am working on.
That’s wonderful, Logan, but why?
For a long time I struggled to find the confidence to share my projects so publicly. But one day, while simultaneously listening to a podcast, watching youtube and playing a video game I had a stark realization. 
You are a consumer, not a creator.
In this rare moment of inspiration I lifted my head above the murky waters of the various media I was constantly drowning myself with and gasped. “Not true!” I thought, “I can play guitar a little! Obviously I am an artist!” Then came the timeless adage, if an artist arts in the woods and no body hears, then who cares?
Long story short, I wanted to start being a creator. I wanted to spend more time thinking, writing, and producing rather than sitting every evening enjoying the thoughts, words and products of others. What if one day someone sat down at the end of their day to enjoy what I made? Wouldn’t that be incredible?
So with my eureka moment behind me, I began. I have stumbled a lot along the way, and the projects you will find here are far from perfect. But I take a lot of inspiration from this video and the mantra within, “Finished not Perfect.” Jake explains it very well, so please watch the video.
So here I am, writing a blog for the first time since I had a xanga in high school. And for what? Two reasons come to mind immediately. First, I genuinely hope to entertain anyone who stops by. And second, I also want to encourage others to spend more time creating.
And with that, I bid you all goodnight!
